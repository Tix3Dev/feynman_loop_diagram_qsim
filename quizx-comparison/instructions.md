# Steps to run execute Feynman loop diagram quantum circuits using quizx

NOTE: This was only tested on Ubuntu, as the required packages are much more difficult to work with on Windows.

(0. `python_generated_dot_2eloop.txt` and `python_generated_dot_4eloop.txt` can be generated by running `pyzx_to_dot.ipynb`)
1. `cd quizx-comparison/circuit-runner/`
2. `cargo build --release`
3. `./target/release/main python_generated_dot_2eloop.txt` or `./target/release/main python_generated_dot_4eloop.txt`

Thanks to Mark Koch for sharing the original version of the quizx implementation with me.
